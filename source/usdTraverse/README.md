# Simple USD Traversal App for Getting Started

This directory contains a sample program that will open a USD file and print all of the prim node paths within.  It is used in a walkthrough available in the [Getting Started section of the OpenUSD Exchange SDK docs](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/usd/code-docs/usd-exchange-sdk/latest/docs/getting-started.html#integrate-into-an-application)
